# Passman, the Tool-Agnostic; Local-First password manager

## What is Passman?

Passman is a password (pass) manager (man) that focuses on giving the user control over its own passwords.

## The Passman Philosophy.

Passman follows a very simple philosophy: **Your passwords, your problem**, by that is understood to the user that they are responsible for their passwords. Any security can only be as secure as its weakest link, passman aims to put that weakest link directly in the hands of the user.

## Local-First

No more conceding your precious info to a third party, with Passman all of your passwords are encrypted and saved locally, each on their own separate **password file**. (also referred to as 'passman files')

With this approach, the user can be sure that their passwords are not only securely encrypted, but also securely stored, backed-up and up-to-date.

## Tool-Agnostic

One of the core philosophies of passman is tool agnosticism

## Running:
